# Wish List

Wish List is a web application that lets users create an account and store a list of items they want to purchase in the future. Users can upload an image of their item using a url for the image, a url link to purchase the item, and a description of the item.

The dummy user information is stored on [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) using the Firestore feature to relate users to their wish list items.
